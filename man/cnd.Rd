\title{Create a condition object}
\usage{
cnd(.subclass, ..., message = "", call = NULL)

error_cnd(.subclass = NULL, ..., message = "", call = NULL)

warning_cnd(.subclass = NULL, ..., message = "", call = NULL)

message_cnd(.subclass = NULL, ..., message = "", call = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{.subclass}{The condition subclass.}

\item{...}{Named data fields stored inside the condition
object. These dots are evaluated with \link[=tidy-dots]{explicit splicing}.}

\item{message}{A default message to inform the user about the
condition when it is signalled.}

\item{call}{A call documenting what expression caused a condition
to be signalled.}
}
\description{
These constructors make it easy to create subclassed conditions.
Conditions are objects that power the error system in R. They can
also be used for passing messages to pre-established handlers.
}
\details{
\code{cnd()} creates objects inheriting from \code{condition}. Conditions
created with \code{error_cnd()}, \code{warning_cnd()} and \code{message_cnd()}
inherit from \code{error}, \code{warning} or \code{message}.
}
\section{Lifecycle}{


The \code{.type} and \code{.msg} arguments have been renamed to \code{.subclass}
and \code{message}. They are defunct as of rlang 0.3.0.
}

\examples{
# Create a condition inheriting from the s3 type "foo":
cnd <- cnd("foo")

# Signal the condition to potential handlers. Since this is a bare
# condition the signal has no effect if no handlers are set up:
cnd_signal(cnd)

# When a relevant handler is set up, the signal causes the handler
# to be called:
with_handlers(cnd_signal(cnd), foo = exiting(function(c) "caught!"))

# Handlers can be thrown or executed inplace. See with_handlers()
# documentation for more on this.

# Signalling an error condition aborts the current computation:
err <- error_cnd("foo", message = "I am an error")
try(cnd_signal(err))
