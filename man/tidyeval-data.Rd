\title{Data pronoun for tidy evaluation}
\format{An object of class \code{rlang_data_pronoun} of length 0.}
\usage{
.data
}
\description{
This pronoun allows you to be explicit when you refer to an object
inside the data. Referring to the \code{.data} pronoun rather than to
the original data frame has several advantages:
\itemize{
\item Sometimes a computation is not about the whole data but about a
subset. For example, if you supply a grouped data frame to a dplyr
verb, the \code{.data} pronoun contains the group subset.
\item It lets dplyr know that you're referring to a column from the
data, which helps generate correct queries when the source
is a database.
}

The \code{.data} object exported here is useful to import in your
package namespace to avoid a \code{R CMD check} note when referring to
objects from the data mask.
