This is equivalent to \code{\link[base:typeof]{base::typeof()}} with a few differences that
make dispatching easier:
\itemize{
\item The type of one-sided formulas is "quote".
\item The type of quoted symbols is "symbol".
\item The type of character vectors of length 1 is "string".
\item The type of special and builtin functions is "primitive".
}
}
\examples{
type_of(10L)
type_of(~10L)
typeof(~10L)

type_of(letters)
type_of(letters[[1]])

typeof(list)
typeof(`$`)
type_of(list)
type_of(`$`)

type_of(quote(base::list()))
