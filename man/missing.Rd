\description{
Missing values are represented in R with the general symbol
\code{NA}. They can be inserted in almost all data containers: all
atomic vectors except raw vectors can contain missing values. To
achieve this, R automatically converts the general \code{NA} symbol to a
typed missing value appropriate for the target vector. The objects
provided here are aliases for those typed \code{NA} objects.
}
\details{
Typed missing values are necessary because R needs sentinel values
of the same type (i.e. the same machine representation of the data)
as the containers into which they are inserted. The official typed
missing values are \code{NA_integer_}, \code{NA_real_}, \code{NA_character_} and
\code{NA_complex_}. The missing value for logical vectors is simply the
default \code{NA}. The aliases provided in rlang are consistently named
and thus simpler to remember. Also, \code{na_lgl} is provided as an
alias to \code{NA} that makes intent clearer.

Since \code{na_lgl} is the default \code{NA}, expressions such as \code{c(NA, NA)}
yield logical vectors, as there is no data available to indicate the
target type. In the same way, expressions like \code{list(NA)} store a
logical \code{NA}, since lists and environments can contain any types.

# Note that while the base R missing symbols cannot be overwritten,
# that's not the case for rlang's aliases:
na_dbl <- NA
typeof(na_dbl)
