#' Quasiquotation of an expression
#'
#' @description
#'
#' Quasiquotation is the mechanism that makes it possible to program
#' flexibly with tidy evaluation grammars like dplyr. It is enabled in
#' all tidyeval quoting functions, the most fundamental of which are
#' [quo()] and [expr()].
#'
#' Quasiquotation is the combination of quoting an expression while
#' allowing immediate evaluation (unquoting) of part of that
#' expression. We provide both syntactic operators and functional
#' forms for unquoting.
#'
#' - The `!!` operator unquotes its argument. It gets evaluated
#'   immediately in the surrounding context.
#'
#' - The `!!!` operator unquotes and splices its argument. The
#'   argument should represents a list or a vector. Each element will
#'   be embedded in the surrounding call, i.e. each element is
#'   inserted as an argument. If the vector is named, the names are
#'   used as argument names.
#'
#' Use `qq_show()` to experiment with quasiquotation or debug the
#' effect of unquoting operators. `qq_show()` quotes its input,
#' processes unquoted parts, and prints the result with
#' [expr_print()]. This expression printer has a clearer output than
#' the base R printer (see the [documentation topic][expr_print]).
#'
#'
#' @section Unquoting names:
#'
#' When a function takes multiple named arguments
#' (e.g. `dplyr::mutate()`), it is difficult to supply a variable as
#' name. Since the LHS of `=` is quoted, giving the name of a variable
#' results in the argument having the name of the variable rather than
#' the name stored in that variable. This problem is right up the
#' alley for the unquoting operator `!!`. If you were able to unquote
#' the variable when supplying the name, the argument would be named
#' after the content of that variable.
#'
#' Unfortunately R is very strict about the kind of expressions
#' supported on the LHS of `=`. This is why we have made the more
#' flexible `:=` operator an alias of `=`. You can use it to supply
#' names, e.g. `a := b` is equivalent to `a = b`. Since its syntax is
#' more flexible you can unquote on the LHS:
#'
#' ```
#' name <- "Jane"
#'
#' dots_list(!!name := 1 + 2)
#' exprs(!!name := 1 + 2)
#' quos(!!name := 1 + 2)
#' ```
#'
#' Like `=`, the `:=` operator expects strings or symbols on its LHS.
#'
#'
#' @section Theory:
#'
#' Formally, `quo()` and `expr()` are quasiquote functions, `!!` is
#' the unquote operator, and `!!!` is the unquote-splice operator.
#' These terms have a rich history in Lisp languages, and live on in
#' modern languages like
#' [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/metaprogramming/)
#' and
#' [Racket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/quasiquote.html).
#'
#'
#' @section Life cycle:
#'
#' * Calling `UQ()` and `UQS()` with the rlang namespace qualifier is
#'   soft-deprecated as of rlang 0.2.0. Just use the unqualified forms
#'   instead.
#'
#'   Supporting namespace qualifiers complicates the implementation of
#'   unquotation and is misleading as to the nature of unquoting
#'   operators (these are syntactic operators that operates at
#'   quotation-time rather than function calls at evaluation-time).
#'
#' * `UQ()` and `UQS()` were soft-deprecated in rlang 0.2.0 in order
#'   to make the syntax of quasiquotation more consistent. The prefix
#'   forms are now \code{`!!`()} and \code{`!!!`()} which is
#'   consistent with other R operators (e.g. \code{`+`(a, b)} is the
#'   prefix form of `a + b`).
#'
#'   Note that the prefix forms are not as relevant as before because
#'   `!!` now has the right operator precedence, i.e. the same as
#'   unary `-` or `+`. It is thus safe to mingle it with other
#'   operators, e.g. `!!a + !!b` does the right thing. In addition the
#'   parser now strips one level of parentheses around unquoted
#'   expressions. This way `(!!"foo")(...)` expands to `foo(...)`.
#'   These changes make the prefix forms less useful.
#'
#'   Finally, the named functional forms `UQ()` and `UQS()` were
#'   misleading because they suggested that existing knowledge about
#'   functions is applicable to quasiquotation. This was reinforced by
#'   the visible definitions of these functions exported by rlang and
#'   by the tidy eval parser interpreting `rlang::UQ()` as `!!`. In
#'   reality unquoting is *not* a function call, it is a syntactic
#'   operation. The operator form makes it clearer that unquoting is
#'   special.
#'
#' * `UQE()` was deprecated in rlang 0.2.0 in order to make the is
#'   deprecated in order to simplify the quasiquotation syntax. You
#'   can replace its use by a combination of `!!` and `get_expr()`.
#'   E.g. `!! get_expr(x)` is equivalent to `UQE(x)`.
#'
#' * The use of `:=` as alias of `~` is defunct as of rlang 0.2.0. It
#'   caused surprising results when invoked in wrong places. For
#'   instance in the expression `dots_list(name := 1)` this operator
#'   was interpreted as a synonym to `=` that supports quasiquotation,
#'   but not in `dots_list(list(name := 1))`. Since `:=` was an alias
#'   for `~` the inner list would contain formula-like object. This
#'   kind of mistakes now trigger an error.
#'
#' @param x An expression to unquote.
#' @name quasiquotation
#' @aliases UQ UQE UQS
#' @examples
#' # Quasiquotation functions quote expressions like base::quote()
#' quote(how_many(this))
#' expr(how_many(this))
#' quo(how_many(this))
#'
#' # In addition, they support unquoting. Let's store symbols
#' # (i.e. object names) in variables:
#' this <- sym("apples")
#' that <- sym("oranges")
#'
#' # With unquotation you can insert the contents of these variables
#' # inside the quoted expression:
#' expr(how_many(!!this))
#' expr(how_many(!!that))
#'
#' # You can also insert values:
#' expr(how_many(!!(1 + 2)))
#' quo(how_many(!!(1 + 2)))
#'
#'
#' # Note that when you unquote complex objects into an expression,
#' # the base R printer may be a bit misleading. For instance compare
#' # the output of `expr()` and `quo()` (which uses a custom printer)
#' # when we unquote an integer vector:
#' expr(how_many(!!(1:10)))
#' quo(how_many(!!(1:10)))
#'
#' # This is why it's often useful to use qq_show() to examine the
#' # result of unquotation operators. It uses the same printer as
#' # quosures but does not return anything:
#' qq_show(how_many(!!(1:10)))
#'
#'
#' # Use `!!!` to add multiple arguments to a function. Its argument
#' # should evaluate to a list or vector:
#' args <- list(1:3, na.rm = TRUE)
#' quo(mean(!!!args))
#'
#' # You can combine the two
#' var <- quote(xyz)
#' extra_args <- list(trim = 0.9, na.rm = TRUE)
#' quo(mean(!!var , !!!extra_args))
#'
#'
#' # The plural versions have support for the `:=` operator.
#' # Like `=`, `:=` creates named arguments:
#' quos(mouse1 := bernard, mouse2 = bianca)
#'
#' # The `:=` is mainly useful to unquote names. Unlike `=` it
#' # supports `!!` on its LHS:
#' var <- "unquote me!"
#' quos(!!var := bernard, mouse2 = bianca)
#'
#'
#' # All these features apply to dots captured by enquos():
#' fn <- function(...) enquos(...)
#' fn(!!! args, !!var := penny)
#'
#'
#' # Unquoting is especially useful for building an expression by
#' # expanding around a variable part (the unquoted part):
#' quo1 <- quo(toupper(foo))
#' quo1
#'
#' quo2 <- quo(paste(!!quo1, bar))
#' quo2
#'
#' quo3 <- quo(list(!!quo2, !!!syms(letters[1:5])))

#' Process unquote operators in a captured expression
#'
#' While all capturing functions in the tidy evaluation framework
#' perform unquote on capture (most notably [quo()]),
#' `expr_interp()` manually processes unquoting operators in
#' expressions that are already captured. `expr_interp()` should be
#' called in all user-facing functions expecting a formula as argument
#' to provide the same quasiquotation functionality as NSE functions.
#'
#' @param x A function, raw expression, or formula to interpolate.
#' @param env The environment in which unquoted expressions should be
#'   evaluated. By default, the formula or closure environment if a
#'   formula or a function, or the current environment otherwise.
#' @export
#' @examples
#' # All tidy NSE functions like quo() unquote on capture:
#' quo(list(!!(1 + 2)))
#'
#' # expr_interp() is meant to provide the same functionality when you
#' # have a formula or expression that might contain unquoting
#' # operators:
#' f <- ~list(!!(1 + 2))
#' expr_interp(f)
#'
#' # Note that only the outer formula is unquoted (which is a reason
#' # to use expr_interp() as early as possible in all user-facing
#' # functions):
#' f <- ~list(~!!(1 + 2), !!(1 + 2))
#' expr_interp(f)
#'
#'
#' # Another purpose for expr_interp() is to interpolate a closure's
#' # body. This is useful to inline a function within another. The
#' # important limitation is that all formal arguments of the inlined
#' # function should be defined in the receiving function:
#' other_fn <- function(x) toupper(x)
#'
#' fn <- expr_interp(function(x) {
#'   x <- paste0(x, "_suffix")
#'   !!! body(other_fn)
#' })
#' fn
#' fn("foo")
expr_interp <- function(x, env = NULL) {
  if (is_formula(x)) {
    f_rhs(x) <- .Call(rlang_interp, f_rhs(x), env %||% f_env(x))
  } else if (is_closure(x)) {
    body(x) <- .Call(rlang_interp, body(x), env %||% fn_env(x))
