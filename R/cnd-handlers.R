#' Establish handlers on the stack.
#'
#' Condition handlers are functions established on the evaluation
#' stack (see \code{\link{eval_stack}()}) that are called by R when a
#' condition is signalled (see \code{\link{cnd_signal}()} and
#' \code{\link{abort}()} for two common signal functions). They come
#' in two types: exiting handlers, which jump out of the signalling
#' context and are transferred to \code{with_handlers()} before being
#' executed. And inplace handlers, which are executed within the
#' signal functions.
#'
#' An exiting handler is taking charge of the condition. No other
#' handler on the stack gets a chance to handle the condition. The
#' handler is executed and \code{with_handlers()} returns the return
#' value of that handler. On the other hand, in place handlers do not
#' necessarily take charge. If they return normally, they decline to
#' handle the condition, and R looks for other handlers established on
#' the evaluation stack. Only by jumping to an earlier call frame can
#' an inplace handler take charge of the condition and stop the
#' signalling process. Sometimes, a muffling restart has been
#' established for the purpose of jumping out of the signalling
#' function but not out of the context where the condition was
#' signalled, which allows execution to resume normally. See
#' \code{\link{rst_muffle}()} the \code{muffle} argument of
#' \code{\link{inplace}()} and the \code{mufflable} argument of
#' \code{\link{cnd_signal}()}.
#'
#' Exiting handlers are established first by \code{with_handlers()},
#' and in place handlers are installed in second place. The latter
#' handlers thus take precedence over the former.
#'
#' @inheritParams with_restarts
#' @param .expr An expression to execute in a context where new
#'   handlers are established. The underscored version takes a quoted
#'   expression or a quoted formula.
#' @param ...,.handlers Named handlers. Handlers should inherit from
#'   \code{exiting} or \code{inplace}. See \code{\link{exiting}()} and
#'   \code{\link{inplace}()} for constructing such handlers.
#' @seealso \code{\link{exiting}()}, \code{\link{inplace}()}.

#' @examples
#' # Signal a condition with cnd_signal():
#' fn <- function() {
#'   g()
#'   cat("called?\n")
#'   "fn() return value"
#' }
#' g <- function() {
#'   h()
#'   cat("called?\n")
#' }
#' h <- function() {
#'   cnd_signal("foo")
#'   cat("called?\n")
#' }
#'
#' # Exiting handlers jump to with_handlers() before being
#' # executed. Their return value is handed over:
#' handler <- function(c) "handler return value"
#' with_handlers(fn(), foo = exiting(handler))
#'
#' # In place handlers are called in turn and their return value is
#' # ignored. Returning just means they are declining to take charge of
#' # the condition. However, they can produce side-effects such as
#' # displaying a message:
#' some_handler <- function(c) cat("some handler!\n")
#' other_handler <- function(c) cat("other handler!\n")
#' with_handlers(fn(), foo = inplace(some_handler), foo = inplace(other_handler))
#'
#' # If an in place handler jumps to an earlier context, it takes
#' # charge of the condition and no other handler gets a chance to
#' # deal with it. The canonical way of transferring control is by
#' # jumping to a restart. See with_restarts() and restarting()
#' # documentation for more on this:
#' exiting_handler <- function(c) rst_jump("rst_foo")
#' fn2 <- function() {

#' Create an exiting or in place handler.
#'
#' There are two types of condition handlers: exiting handlers, which
#' are thrown to the place where they have been established (e.g.,
#' \code{\link{with_handlers}()}'s evaluation frame), and local
#' handlers, which are executed in place (e.g., where the condition
#' has been signalled). \code{exiting()} and \code{inplace()} create
#' handlers suitable for \code{\link{with_handlers}()}.
#'
#' A subtle point in the R language is that conditions are not thrown,
#' handlers are. \code{\link[base]{tryCatch}()} and
#' \code{\link{with_handlers}()} actually catch handlers rather than
#' conditions. When a critical condition signalled with
#' \code{\link[base]{stop}()} or \code{\link{abort}()}, R inspects the
#' handler stack and looks for a handler that can deal with the
#' condition. If it finds an exiting handler, it throws it to the
#' function that established it (\code{\link{with_handlers}()}). That
#' is, it interrupts the normal course of evaluation and jumps to
#' \code{with_handlers()} evaluation frame (see
#' \code{\link{eval_stack}()}), and only then and there the handler is
#' called. On the other hand, if R finds an inplace handler, it
#' executes it locally. The inplace handler can choose to handle the
#' condition by jumping out of the frame (see \code{\link{rst_jump}()}
#' or \code{\link{return_from}()}). If it returns locally, it declines
#' to handle the condition which is passed to the next relevant
#' handler on the stack. If no handler is found or is able to deal
#' with the critical condition (by jumping out of the frame), R will
#' then jump out of the faulty evaluation frame to top-level, via the
#' abort restart (see \code{\link{rst_abort}()}).
#'
#' @param handler A handler function that takes a condition as
#'   argument. This is passed to \code{\link{as_function}()} and can
#'   thus be a formula describing a lambda function.
#' @param muffle Whether to muffle the condition after executing an
#'   inplace handler. The signalling function must have established a
#'   muffling restart. Otherwise, an error will be issued.
#' @seealso \code{\link{with_handlers}()} for examples,
#'   \code{\link{restarting}()} for another kind of inplace handler.
#' @export
#' @examples
#' # You can supply a function taking a condition as argument:
#' hnd <- exiting(function(c) cat("handled foo\n"))
#' with_handlers(cnd_signal("foo"), foo = hnd)

#' with_handlers(foo = inplace(~cat("hello", .$attr, "\n")), {
#'   cnd_signal("foo", attr = "there")
#'   "foo"

#' Create a restarting handler.
#'
#' This constructor automates the common task of creating an
#' \code{\link{inplace}()} handler that invokes a restart.
#'
#' Jumping to a restart point from an inplace handler has two
#' effects. First, the control flow jumps to wherever the restart was
#' established, and the restart function is called (with \code{...},
#' \code{.args} or \code{.fields} as arguments). Execution resumes
#' from the \code{\link{with_restarts}()} call. Secondly, the transfer
#' of the control flow out of the function that signalled the
#' condition means that the handler has dealt with the condition. Thus
#' the condition will not be passed on to other potential handlers
#' established on the stack.
#'
#' @param .restart The name of a restart.
#' @param .fields A character vector specifying the fields of the
#'   condition that should be passed as arguments to the restart. If
#'   named, the names (except empty names \code{""}) are used as
#'   argument names for calling the restart function. Otherwise the
#'   the fields themselves are used as argument names.
#' @param ...,.args Additional arguments passed on the restart
#'   function. These arguments are evaluated only once and
#'   immediately, when creating the restarting handler.
#'
#' @export
#' @seealso \code{\link{inplace}()} and \code{\link{exiting}()}.
#' @examples
#' # This is a restart that takes a data frame and names as arguments
#' rst_bar <- function(df, nms) {
#'   stats::setNames(df, nms)
#' }
#'
#' # This restart is simpler and does not take arguments
#' rst_baz <- function() "baz"

#' )
#'
#' # The restarting handlers jumps to `rst_bar` when `foo` is signalled:
#' with_handlers(fn(), foo = restart_bar)

#' # The restarting() constructor is especially nice to use with
#' # restarts that do not need arguments:
